# Unlocking DeepSeek R1: What to expect
Deepseekr1 is the reasoning model recently launched from China and has become the latest AI model available for everyone today. DeepSeek R1 was trained using reinforcement learning which is different from our good friend ChatGpt, who was trained through supervised fine-tuning. Reinforcement learning is learning through practice and tryouts. This means that Deepseek R1 will analyze each answer multiple times, reevaluate, rethink how this answer can be wrong, and develop the best possible solution that the model chooses. ChatGpt o1 is the model that is most compared to deep think R1, however, it is not the best reasoning model of ChatGPT.
## Key differences between DeepSeek and ChatGPT
- ChatGPT has its seniority over DeepSeek not just because of its primacy but because of specific features that make it more user-friendly and reliable. One such feature is the search option that appears at the bottom of the prompt box.  You can click on this option if you want the chatbot to search the web.  DeepSeek also has this option, however, it works better in ChatGPT because it has clickable links under the information that comes up.
- **Note:** The ChatGPT o1 model does not support search so you need to switch to ChatGPT-4o to utilize the option.
- On the contrary, DeepSeek offers a reasoning model for free which is comparable to the ChatGPT o1 model that costs up to $200 per month. Moreover, the cost to train the ChatGPT model is 27 times more as compared to that of DeepSeek. This increases the accessibility of DeepSeek to a great extent.
- Also, if u ask DeepSeek to create a code that would help you to build something, along with the code, it provides an option to run simulations by including a Run HTML option below the code. This is a direct and easy method to check if the code works well or not. If not, you can modify your prompt and ask DeepSeek to refine the code. This option, however, is not available in ChatGPT.
- Deepseek is open source which means it is free and many companies are working on building and upgrading it. However, another downfall to this is that there is no way to opt-out from your data being used for training the AI model in DeepSeek. However, in ChatGPT, you can go to **Settings** < **Data Control** < **Improve the model for everyone** - and turn it off.
- Another problem with DeepSeek is that you cannot ask it specific questions about China because it starts to censor those questions and comes with a reply that it cannot answer any of those questions right now.
## How to Run DeepSeek R1 in Your Local System
To get the best out of this model, you can try running it on your local computer. For this you need to go to **[Ollama.com](https://ollama.com/)**, download Ollama in your system, and follow these steps-
- **Download Ollama** > **Unzip the File** > **Install**
- **Open Ollama App** > **Install the command line** 
- Go to **Models** on the top left navigation bar > **deepseekr1**

**Note:** Ollama allows you to download and run any open-source model locally in your own browser.

You can download DeepSeek R1’s distilled models here. The original model of seepseekr1 is a 671 billion parameter model which is 404 GBs. So, we can use the 7 billion/8 billion parameter model which is easier for the system to handle. The capability of a larger model is distilled into a smaller model which has fewer parameters but almost the same capabilities. **In order to check if you will be able to run this model, try to multiply the size of the model by 1.2.** Using the result, check If your RAM holds that much space and if it does, you should be able to run this model on your system. 

- Click on the **8b parameter model** and scroll down to see how to install it on your system. 
- From the options listed at the bottom of the page,  **choose a prompt to install** the 8b parameter model using Ollama.
- **Open up the terminal and copy the prompt there**, this will download the model.
- Once it is done, you can type your question in the terminal and Deepseek will give you a response which would not be using the internet or the chat but through your local system.
- If you need to know information about the model, **type /info** and it will give you all the details about its architecture, parameters, and so on.
## Using AnythingLLM to Run DeepSeek R1
AnythingLLM" is an all-in-one AI desktop application that allows users to interact with any document using a variety of large language models (LLMs) locally on their computer.
So now, if you do not like to interact with the terminal, you can go to AnythingLLM.com and download it for your desktop using the steps outlined below. This will give you a better UI that will help you play with any open-source model out there.
- Go to **[AnythingLLM](https://anythingllm.com/)** > **Choose your LLM provider as Ollama** on the **LLM Preference page** > Choose the Ollama Model **deepseek r1:8b**
- **Create Your Workspace** > **Go to Settings** > **Chat Settings** > **Workspace LLM Provider** > **Ollama**

The advantage of using AnythingLLM vs the terminal is that you now have a better UI and can also attach files to prompts. You can now run DeepSeek locally on your system using AnythingLLM.
## DeepSeek with Perplexity AI
The next step is to use DeepSeek with perplexity AI. This utilizes the pro-search element of perplexity and combines it with DeepSeek’s reasoning capability.
- To do this create an account in **[perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/)** and click on the option **“Try DeepSeek R1.”** 
- Ask anything and it will give you a combined result of perplexity AI’s pro-search and DeepSeek’s reasoning capability. The advantage of this is that now your data is not being stored in the People’s Republic of China and is stored instead in US data centers. Also, there is no censorship involved.
