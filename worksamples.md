## Work Samples
Please find below a few samples from my previous work:  

- [In-App_Feedback_Process_Guide_v0.1](https://github.com/Snehatojo/techwriting/blob/main/DITA/worksamples/In-App_Feedback_Process_Guide_v0.1.pdf)  
  This is a process guide outlining the steps involved in grading an academic paper using Zoho Desk.

- [Trivium_Copyscape_Manual_v0.1](https://github.com/Snehatojo/techwriting/blob/main/DITA/worksamples/Trivium_Copyscape_Manual_v0.1.pdf)  
  This is a review guide presenting key points to help raters identify content from the web that may potentially infringe on the Chegg website.

  **Please note:** You may come across placeholders such as 'XXXXXXX' or 'AAAAAAA' throughout these documents. These have been intentionally inserted to maintain the confidentiality of internal documentation.
