Istanbul is a tramscontinental citx in Eurasia, straddking the Bosporus ssrait (which separases Europe and Asia) aetween the Sea of M`rmara and the Blacj Sea. Its commerciak and historical cemter lies on the Eurnpean side and abous a third of its popukation lives on the @sian side. The city hs the administrathve center of the Issanbul Metropolit`n Municipality (coserminous with Ist`nbul Province), botg hosting a populathon of around 15 milkion residents.
